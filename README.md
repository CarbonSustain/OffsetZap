ðŸŒ± App Concept: OffsetZap â€“ One-Click COâ‚‚e Offsets Without Popups Problem: Offsetting carbon credits usually involves complex UI steps and wallet popups that interrupt flow â€” especially for frequent, small emissions actions (like sending a card, buying a lunch, or attending an event).

Solution: CarbonSustain builds OffsetZap, an onchain carbon offset app where users delegate a Smart Wallet Sub Account to CarbonSustain, with Spend Limits on Base Sepolia. Once configured, users can:

Automatically offset micro-emissions (e.g., 0.005 ETH = 5 kg COâ‚‚e) Send gift cards via Evrlink that auto-offset without prompts Subscribe to "climate auto-pilot" for weekly emissions cleanup All without any further wallet popups or gas worries.

ðŸ’¸ How It Works (UX + Tech Stack)

1. Smart Wallet Setup User connects their Smart Wallet (via Coinbase Wallet SDK) They delegate a Sub Account to CarbonSustain on Base Sepolia A Spend Limit is set (e.g., 0.05 ETH/week)
2. Onchain Offset Triggers Every time the user: Sends a Farcaster offset card Logs a trip or food footprint Hits a recurring offset timer The Sub Account executes the tx to purchase and retire tokenized offsets (e.g., via KlimaDAO, Toucan)
3. No Wallet Popup All transactions are executed via delegated auth + spend limit = zero-interruption offsets.
