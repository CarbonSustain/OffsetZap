Key can be a public key from either the Ed25519 or ECDSA(secp256k1) signature schemes, where\n in the ECDSA(secp256k1) case we require the 33-byte compressed form of the public key. We call\n these public keys <b>primitive keys</b>.\n A Key can also be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is then authorized to perform any\n precompiled contract action that requires this key to sign.\n Note that when a Key is a smart contract ID, it <i>doesn't</i> mean the contract with that ID\n will actually create a cryptographic signature. It only means that when the contract calls a\n precompiled contract, the resulting \"child transaction\" will be authorized to perform any action\n controlled by the Key.\n Exactly one of the possible values should be populated in order for the Key to be valid."},"id":6837,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":6828,"mutability":"mutable","name":"inheritAccountKey","nameLocation":"4871:17:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6837,"src":"4866:22:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"},"typeName":{"id":6827,"name":"bool","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4866:4:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6830,"mutability":"mutable","name":"contractId","nameLocation":"4992:10:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6837,"src":"4984:18:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":6829,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4984:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6832,"mutability":"mutable","name":"ed25519","nameLocation":"5055:7:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6837,"src":"5049:13:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":6831,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5049:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6834,"mutability":"mutable","name":"ECDSA_secp256k1","nameLocation":"5135:15:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6837,"src":"5129:21:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":6833,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5129:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6836,"mutability":"mutable","name":"delegatableContractId","nameLocation":"5705:21:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6837,"src":"5697:29:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":6835,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5697:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"KeyValue","nameLocation":"4746:8:7","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":7664,"src":"4739:994:7","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"IHederaTokenService.TokenKey","documentation":{"id":6838,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5739:83:7","text":"A list of token key types the key should be applied to and the value of the key"},"id":6844,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":6840,"mutability":"mutable","name":"keyType","nameLocation":"6241:7:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6844,"src":"6236:12:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":6839,"name":"uint","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"6236:4:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6843,"mutability":"mutable","name":"key","nameLocation":"6322:3:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6844,"src":"6313:12:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_struct$_KeyValue_$6837_storage_ptr","typeString":"struct IHederaTokenService.KeyValue"},"typeName":{"id":6842,"nodeType":"UserDefinedTypeName","pathNode":{"id":6841,"name":"KeyValue","nameLocations":["6313:8:7"],"nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":6837,"src":"6313:8:7"},"referencedDeclaration":6837,"src":"6313:8:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_struct$_KeyValue_$6837_storage_ptr","typeString":"struct IHederaTokenService.KeyValue"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"TokenKey","nameLocation":"5834:8:7","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":7664,"src":"5827:505:7","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"IHederaTokenService.HederaToken","documentation":{"id":6845,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"6338:188:7","text":"Basic properties of a Hedera Token - name, symbol, memo, tokenSupplyType, maxSupply,\n treasury, freezeDefault.
