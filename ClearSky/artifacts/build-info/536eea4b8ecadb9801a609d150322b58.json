@title SeriesVault\n @notice Custodies multiple fungible CSLP tokens (one token per pool) and mints a single Series NFT per bundle.\n         Each Series NFT serial uniquely maps to the deposited bundle: { tokenIds[], amounts[] }.\n         Flow:\n           - User calls depositAndMint(tokenIds, amounts, to)\n           - Vault associates to those tokenIds (lazy) and transfers CSLPs from msg.sender into the vault\n           - Vault mints ONE Series NFT (new serial) to `to`\n           - Later, holder calls redeem(serial, to) -> burns the Series NFT and returns all CSLPs to `to`\n         Notes:\n         - This contract uses Hedera HTS precompiles via HederaTokenService.\n         - For FT (CSLP) transfers FROM msg.sender TO this contract, the user must be the external caller\n           so their outer transaction signature authorizes the transfer (no per-token allowance needed)."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":6593,"linearizedBaseContracts":[6593,246,147,177,5766,4309],"name":"SeriesVault","nameLocation":"1237:11:7","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"constant":false,"functionSelector":"37b0ac19","id":5809,"mutability":"mutable","name":"seriesToken","nameLocation":"1400:11:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6593,"src":"1385:26:7","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":5808,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1385:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"public"},{"constant":false,"functionSelector":"0a8de691","id":5811,"mutability":"mutable","name":"seriesTokenCreated","nameLocation":"1468:18:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6593,"src":"1456:30:7","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"},"typeName":{"id":5810,"name":"bool","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1456:4:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}},"visibility":"public"},{"constant":false,"functionSelector":"31f120f2","id":5813,"mutability":"mutable","name":"seriesTokenId","nameLocation":"1505:13:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6593,"src":"1492:26:7","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"},"typeName":{"id":5812,"name":"int64","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1492:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"}},"visibility":"public"},{"anonymous":false,"eventSelector":"a4d11af2ab42095905c649cae30275a71760ffbb8b95fb2fb8e4b6fc2e1300e7","id":5819,"name":"SeriesTokenCreated","nameLocation":"1592:18:7","nodeType":"EventDefinition","parameters":{"id":5818,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":5815,"indexed":false,"mutability":"mutable","name":"tokenAddress","nameLocation":"1619:12:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":5819,"src":"1611:20:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":5814,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1611:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":5817,"indexed":false,"mutability":"mutable","name":"tokenId","nameLocation":"1639:7:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":5819,"src":"1633:13:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"},"typeName":{"id":5816,"name":"int64","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1633:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"1610:37:7"},"src":"1586:62:7"},{"anonymous":false,"eventSelector":"f2238c4b5e42a79781650f026c0fa4cb13fcbcb1ef7345fe721b948ce208860d","id":5827,"name":"HTSCreateResult","nameLocation":"1659:15:7","nodeType":"EventDefinition","parameters":{"id":5826,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":5821,"indexed":false,"mutability":"mutable","name":"rc","nameLocation":"1679:2:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":5827,"src":"1675:6:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int256","typeString":"int256"},"typeName":{"id":5820,"name":"int","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1675:3:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int256","typeString":"int256"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":5823,"indexed":false,"mutability":"mutable","name":"evmAddr","nameLocation":"1691:7:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":5827,"src":"1683:15:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":5822,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1683:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":5825,"indexed":false,"mutability":"mutable","name":"tokenId","nameLocation":"1706:7:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":5827,"src":"1700:13:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"},"typeName":{"id":5824,"name":"int64","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1700:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_int64","typeString":"int64"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"1674:40:7"},"src":"1653:62:7"},{"constant":false,"functionSelector":"158ef93e","id":5829,"mutability":"mutable","name":"initialized","nameLocation":"1732:11:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6593,"src":"1720:23:7","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","ty
